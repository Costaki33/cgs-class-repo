Here in homework01 folder, I have three files:

1. odd-even.py
2. prime_numberlist.py
3. words.py 
4. README.md
odd-even.py takes the nums list with various integers and prints whether each value is either odd or even

prime_numberlist.py finds all the primes in the range from (3, 100)

and words.py imports the dictionary and prints both the first 10 words, as well as words that start with "pyt"

This directory also contains this README.md file
